The story concerns a Hare who ridicules a slow-moving Tortoise.
Tired of the Hare's boastful behaviour, the Tortoise challenges him to a race.
The hare soon leaves the tortoise behind and, confident of winning, takes a nap midway through the race.
When the Hare awakes however, he finds that his competitor, crawling slowly but steadily, has arrived before him.
